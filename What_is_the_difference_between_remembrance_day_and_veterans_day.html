The red corn <b>poppy</b> (Papaver rheoeas) was native to Europe and also was prominent in the Napoleonic Wars. &ldquo;In Flanders Field&rdquo; became an instant favorite all over the world. It was particularly popular in Canada and the United States. Ads featuring lines from it helped raise $400 million for the war effort in Canada alone.  <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> is always observed officially on November 11, regardless of the <b>day</b> of the week on which it falls. The <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> National Ceremony, like most ceremonies around the nation, is held on <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> itself.
