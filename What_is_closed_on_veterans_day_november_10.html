        <h2><strong>What is closed on veterans day november 10 Why is veterans day celebrated on november 11th</strong></h2>
        <p>In the essay, Veterans Day: Never Forget Their <b>Duty</b>, Mike Christian was a POW, captured by the Vietnam. As stated in the text, he sewed an American flag so him and the other POW&rsquo;s that were captured could say the pledge of allegiance.  This is shown by John McCain in his essay &ldquo;Veterans <b>Day</b>: <b>Never</b> <b>Forget</b> <b>Their</b> <b>Duty</b>.&rdquo; He tells his story about being a prisoner of war (POW), and of a man named Mike Christian who showed and act of patriotism.  From presidents to poets, soldiers to civilians, these 45 Veterans <b>Day</b> quotes capture the spirit and essence of Veterans <b>Day</b>. They remind us of the importance of service, sacrifice, and patriotism, and they inspire us to continue to strive for a better and more just world for all.  He or she loves this nation and is willing to sacrifice himself, one is loyal to our country, and lastly but not least, preserves through hard times. In the story by John McCain, <b>Veteran</b>&rsquo;s <b>Day</b>: <b>Never</b> <b>Forget</b> <b>Their</b> <b>Duty</b>, he tells us about a man in the military with him who sacrificed himself&hellip;show more content&hellip;.  Every year since 1919 on November 11th, America celebrates Veterans <b>Day</b>. However, do our people truly understand the meaning behind putting on that army camouflage uniform. Now, the term hero is used very loosely and it is losing its meaning throughout the nation.  Peace is imperiled when we forget to try for agreements and settlements and treaties; when we <b>forget</b> to hold out our hands and strive; when we <b>forget</b> that God gave us talents to use in securing the ends He desires.  In the story &quot;Veterans <b>Day</b>: <b>Never</b> <b>Forget</b> <b>Their</b> <b>Duty</b>&quot; is about veterans who are P.O.W.s in North Vietnam. They were captured and tortured. But even going through all that they are still able to salute the flag of The United States Of America.  Here is a collection of inspirational Veterans <b>Day</b> quotes to support you in your time of reflection. 1. &quot;Valor is stability, not of legs and arms, but of courage and the soul.&quot; -- Michel de ...  In fact, Veterans <b>Day</b> is largely intended to thank LIVING veterans for their service, to acknowledge that their contributions to our national security are appreciated, and to underscore the fact that all those who served &ndash; not only those who died &ndash; have sacrificed and done their <b>duty</b>. </p>        <p>Restaurants with veterans day deals near me. <a href="https://veteransdays.github.io/veteran5/850.html">Veterans day crossfit hero wod</a>. <a href="./627.html">Veterans day 22</a>. <a href="https://veteransdays.github.io/veteran5/420.html">Is us customs open on veterans day</a>.
